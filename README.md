ROS2 Demo Launch Instructions:

```

### 3.5 Operation Mode:

The operation mode can be configured via the `custom_map_mode` parameter in config/control_command.yaml.

#### Odometry mode

Set `custom_map_mode = 0` to enable odometry mode. In this mode, the map frame and odom frame share the same pose.

#### SLAM mode

Set `custom_map_mode = 1` to enable slam mode. This mode provides a complete SLAM system that builds upon the Odometry Mode by adding **loop closure detection** and **map saving** capabilities.

After launching the driver, odin1 will automatically perform mapping and cache map data. When the scene capture is complete, users need to execute `./set_param.sh save_map 1` in the driver's source directory to save all map data collected since the program started. The map will be saved to the location specified by the `mapping_result_dest_dir` and `mapping_result_file_name` parameters in config/control_command.yaml. If these parameters are not specified, default values will be used.

After the initial save, you can execute the command again to save a new map. Each save operation will generate a new map file. (Please allow at least 5 seconds between consecutive save operations)

The map origin corresponds to the odom coordinate system's origin at the program's startup.

##### Relocalization mode

To enable relocalization, set `custom_map_mode = 2` and specify the absolute path to the pre-built map using the `relocalization_map_abs_path` parameter in config/control_command.yaml.

Once launched, odin1 will initiate the relocalization process based on the current viewpoint and the specified map. To ensure a high success rate, it is recommended to starting within 1 meter ±10 degrees of the original position and orientation from the SLAM trajectory.

Note that relocalization performance is highly environment-dependent. In highly distinctive scenes, successful matching may occur even beyond the 1m/10° range, while other environments may require more stringent conditions. We advise testing in your target environment to determine practical tolerances.

If relocalization fails initially, the system will temporarily operate in a fallback SLAM mode (map saving is disabled in this state). During this time, you can freely move odin1. It will continue relocalization attempts in the background. Once successful, the TF between map and odom frames will be published. (Tip: Gently shaking or moving the device after initialization can help improve relocalization accuracy.)

The following topics are published in the odom frame: `/odin1/cloud_slam, /odin1/odom, /odin1/highodom and /odin1/path`. To obtain these in the map frame, apply the TF from odom frame to map frame.

### 4.3 ROS topics
Internal parameters of the Odin ROS driver are defined in config/control_command.yaml. Below are descriptions of the commonly used parameters:

| Topic               |control_command.yaml  | Detailed Description |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| odin1/imu                     | sendimu           | Imu Topic |

| odin1/image_undistort         | sendrgbundistort  | undistorted RGB Camera Topic, processed with calib.yaml from device |
| odin1/image/compressed        | sendrgbcompressed | RGB Camera compressed Topic, original jpeg data from device |
| odin1/cloud_raw               | senddtof          | Raw_Cloud Topic |
| odin1/cloud_render            | sendcloudrender   | Render_Cloud Topic, processed with raw point cloud, rgb image, and calib.yaml from device |

| odin1/depth_img_competetion_cloud  | senddepth         | Dense Depth_Cloud Topic. Demo, high computing power required |

### 4.4 Data format

1. The raw point cloud (cloud_raw) has the following fields:
```
float32 x             // X axis, in meters
float32 y             // Y axis, in meters
float32 z             // Z axis, in meters
uint8  intensity      // Reflectivity, range 0–255
uint16 confidence     // Point confidence, range 0–65535
float32 offset_time   // Time offset relative to the base timestamp unit: s 
```

To work with this custom format in PCL, first define the point type:
```cpp
/*** LS ***/
namespace ls_ros {
    struct EIGEN_ALIGN16 Point {
        float x;
        float y;
        float z;
        uint8_t intensity;
        uint16_t confidence;
        float offset_time;
        EIGEN_MAKE_ALIGNED_OPERATOR_NEW
    };
}  // namespace ls_ros

POINT_CLOUD_REGISTER_POINT_STRUCT(ls_ros::Point,
      (float, x, x)
      (float, y, y)
      (float, z, z)
      (uint8_t, intensity, intensity)
      (uint16_t, confidence, confidence)
      (float offset_time , offset_time)
)
```
Then, you can easily convert a ROS sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 message into a PCL point cloud:
```
pcl::PointCloud<ls_ros::Point> ls_cloud;
pcl::fromROSMsg(*msg, ls_cloud);
```

2. The slam point cloud (cloud_slam) and directly rendered point cloud (cloud_render) has the following fields:
```
float32 x             // X axis, in meters
float32 y             // Y axis, in meters
float32 z             // Z axis, in meters
float32 rgb           // RGB value
```

### 4.5 Other functionalities

## 5. FAQ
### 5.1 Segmentation fault upon re-launching host SDK
**Error Message**  
No device connected after 60 seconds 

**Solution**  
1. Please power on Odin module again # Disconnect and reconnect odin power

2. Reinitialize Odin SDK # Execute SDK after device reboot


### 5.2 Library binding failure during compilation

**Error Message**  
ld: cannot find -llydHostApi or symbol lookup errors

**Resolution** 

1. Clean previous build artifacts

ROS1 
```shell
rm -rf devel/ build/  
``` 
ROS2
```shell
rm -rf devel/ install/ log/ 
``` 
2. Re-run script installation

### 5.3 Docker GUI passthrough failure

**Error Message**  
Unable to open X display or No protocol specified

**Resolution** 
```shell
xhost + #This command enables graphical passthrough to Docker containers
``` 

### 5.4 ROS driver exit with get version failed error

**Error Message**  
```shell
<ERROR><api.cpp:lidar_get_version:672>: get device version fail.
get version failed.
```

**Resolution** 

Device firmware version is too low, please update to latest version.


### 5.5 RVIZ has not responded for a long time

**Error Message**  
Rviz does not respond, and after a while the terminal prints Device disconnected, waiting for reconnection...

**Resolution** 

Please power on Odin module again

### 5.6 Device not responding

**Error Message**  
Missed ok response from device,probably wrong interaction procedure.

**Resolution** 

Please adopt the solution mentioned in 5.1

### 5.7 Device has no external calibration file 

**Error Message**  
ERROR：Missing camera node 'cam_0'

**Resolution** 

Please plug and unplug the USB again

### 5.8 ROS Driver report device disconnected immediately after stream started

**Error Message**  

```shell
Device ready and streams activated
Device detaching...
Wating for device reconnection...
Device disconnected, waiting for reconnection...
```

**Reason**

Mostly common on ros2 environment and connected to complex network environment, such as office wifi & ethernet. ROS2 default to broadcast, and complex network environment will cause ros2 publish to block, leading to device disconnection.

**Resolution** 

If cross-device communication is not required, please restrict ros2 to localhost only with:
```shell
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1
```

If cross-device communication is required, please simplify the network environment as much as possible. Mini local network with only required devices is recommended.

### 5.9 ROS Driver died immediately after stream started

**Error Message**  

```shell
Device ready and streams activated
[host_sdk_sample-2] process has died ......
```

**Test**

Disable odin1/image	with sendrgb = 0 in control_command.yaml and try again. If the driver now works, it is likely that the issue is related to multiple version of opencv is installed on the system.

**Resolution** 

Purge the unused version of opencv and maintain a single complete version, then rebuild the driver and try again.
